            set fire to coal until it turns into fathoms
        </li>
        <li>
            When the fathoms were made, put the fathoms on the spit (you must place your hand on top of the fathoms and if it holds for 10 seconds, it is the ideal height, if it doesn't hold, you should raise the grill, if you hold for more than 10 seconds, you should lower the grill)
        </li>
        <li>
            place the meat on the bone side until it is cooked or takes on a darker color.
